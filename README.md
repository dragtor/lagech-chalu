# Lagech-chalu

Hey , This title seems something different , "Lagech-chalu" is native word in marathi . That means quick-start . 

We usually requires to setup our new laptop for application software development purposes, it may involve simple task like installing basic application like Vim , or Zsh ,  Also there are many resources are required to develop an application like DBs like mysql , mongo or Streaming Services like kafka, rabbitmq , redisq . 

In this repo , I have maintained docker-compose file for resources setup . Also added scripts which we require to setup our laptop after fresh OS installation.
